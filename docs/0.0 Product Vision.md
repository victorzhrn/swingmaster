## Product Definition

## The Problem

**Target Customer:**  
Recreational tennis players (USTA 3.0-4.5) who are serious about improving but don't have regular access to a coach.

**Customer Pain Points:**
- "I record myself playing but can't identify what I'm doing wrong"
- "Even when I feel something's off, I don't know how to fix it"
- "Coaching lessons are expensive and infrequent"
- "Generic YouTube tips don't apply to my specific issues"
- "I make the same mistakes repeatedly without realizing it"

**Market Gap:**  
Existing solutions are either too expensive (private coaching), too generic (YouTube tutorials), or too complex (professional biomechanics tools). There's no middle ground for committed recreational players.
