# Tennis Coach App - MVP Vision 

### 1. Product Identity
**One-liner:** Analyzes tennis swings for recreational players to fix their technique instantly

**The pain:** "I record myself playing tennis but can't see what I'm doing wrong. Even when I know something's off, I don't know how to fix it."

**NOT doing (MVP):**
- Multi-angle recording
- Real-time coaching during play
- Social features or sharing
- Detailed biomechanics reports
- Training drills or programs

### 2. Value Moment
**The "aha" happens when:** User records a swing and immediately sees a visual marker on their video showing exactly where they're hitting the ball wrong

**User's reaction:** "Oh wow, I'm hitting way behind where I thought I was!"

**Observable signal:** User immediately records another swing to try the correction

---

### 3. User Journey (States, Not Screens)
```
Curious → Recording → Analyzing → Understanding → Practicing
```

**Entry state:** Frustrated with their inconsistent tennis game

**Success path:** 
1. Open app (camera ready)
2. Record swing
3. See visual insight

**Recovery path:** If no swing detected, prompt to upload a video instead

---

### 4. Success Criteria
**North Star:** Time-to-insight (from opening app to understanding what to fix)

**Target:** 90% of users understand their main issue within 45 seconds

**How to measure:** Time from app open to viewing analysis + whether they record a second swing

### 5. Behavioral Contracts
**Core behavior:**
- When: User records or uploads a tennis swing video
- Then: System identifies the swing, marks key points, and shows primary issue
- Quality: Visual marker is precise, coaching tip is specific and actionable

**Example:** "When user records a forehand, system shows contact point with red dot and green target dot 8 inches forward, plus text: 'Hit the ball here instead'"

### 6. Design Principles
**Interaction:** Instant and visual - like having a coach point at your swing

**Language:** Encouraging friend who knows tennis - "Nice shoulder rotation! Try hitting a bit earlier"

**Visual:** Clean and minimal - the video is the star, UI supports without distracting
