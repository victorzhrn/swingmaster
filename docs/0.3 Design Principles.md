# Tennis Coach App - Design Principles

*Version 1.0 – January 2025*

## Design Philosophy

### Core Vision
**"Your AI coach sees what you can't"** – Transform phone cameras into intelligent tennis coaches through instant visual insights and progressive skill development.

### Design Pillars

#### 1. **Instant Insight Architecture**
Every interaction delivers value within 3 seconds:
- Camera opens directly (no splash screens)
- Single-tap recording
- One primary insight per swing
- Visual markers over numerical data

#### 2. **Coach-First Clarity**
Interface teaches through showing, not telling:
- Video overlays demonstrate corrections
- Color vocabulary for instant understanding
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Contextual tips during processing

#### 3. **Performance Mirror**
The app reflects your form with precision:
- Full-screen video as primary canvas
- Minimal UI obstruction (<20% of screen)
- Real-time skeleton tracking
- Before/after visual comparisons

## Visual Design System

### Color Language

```swift
// Technique Assessment
Good Form:        Green (#34C759)
Needs Work:       Yellow (#FFCC00)
Critical Issue:   Red (#FF3B30)
Ideal Reference:  Blue (#007AFF)

// UI States
Recording:        Red (#FF3B30)
Processing:       White with animated opacity
Inactive:         Gray (#8E8E93)

// Swing Types
Forehand:         Blue gradient (#007AFF → #5AC8FA)
Backhand:         Green gradient (#34C759 → #30D158)
Serve:            Purple gradient (#AF52DE → #BF5AF2)
```

### Typography

```swift
// Monospaced for all metrics (prevents layout jitter)
Primary Metric:   .system(size: 24, weight: .bold, design: .monospaced)
Insight Text:     .system(size: 16, weight: .semibold)
Labels:           .system(size: 12, weight: .medium) + 80% opacity
Timeline:         .system(size: 10, weight: .semibold, design: .monospaced)
```

### Glass Overlay System

```swift
// Translucent panels for video overlays
.background(.ultraThinMaterial)
.overlay(
    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12)
        .stroke(Color.white.opacity(0.15), lineWidth: 1)
)
```

## UI Components

### Camera View (Home)
- **Fullscreen camera** with skeleton overlay
- **Bottom control bar**: 3 buttons inline (Upload | Start/End | History)
- **Recording state**: Red END button with subtle glow/shadow (no pulse required)
- **No headers**: Maximize camera visibility

### Analysis View
```
Video Player (70% height)
├── Timeline with shot markers
├── Auto-pause on issues
└── Visual overlay (contact points, swing path)

Insight Panel (30% height)
├── Primary issue with visual reference
├── Coaching instruction
└── Expandable "Why this matters"
```

### History View
- **Video thumbnails** with minimal metrics
- **Tap to review** any session
- **No text-heavy lists**: Visual recognition preferred

---

## Interaction Principles

### 1. **Three-Tap Maximum**
Any core action achievable in ≤3 taps:
- Record swing: 1–2 taps (Start, optional End; auto-stop at 10s)
- View analysis: Automatic after recording
- Review history: 2 taps (History → Session)

### 2. **Smart Defaults**
- Camera always ready on launch
- Auto-detect swings (no manual triggers)
- Auto-pause on problems during playback
- Single insight shown first

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
```
Level 1: "Late contact" + visual marker
    ↓ tap
Level 2: "Hit 8 inches earlier" + diagram
    ↓ tap
Level 3: Technical details + comparison
```

### 4. **Contextual Intelligence**
- **Recording**: Minimal UI, just skeleton
- **Processing**: Show technique tips while waiting
- **Analysis**: Focus on biggest issue first
- **History**: Show improvement trends

---

## Motion & Animation

### Standard Timings
```swift
// Consistent spring animations
Quick:   .spring(response: 0.3, dampingFraction: 0.8)
Normal:  .spring(response: 0.4, dampingFraction: 0.75)
Smooth:  .spring(response: 0.6, dampingFraction: 0.8)
```

### Key Animations
- **END control**: Subtle glow/shadow while recording (no pulse requirement)
- **Shot markers**: Fade in as detected
- **Insights**: Slide up from bottom
- **Overlay graphics**: Draw on with 0.3s delay

---

## Information Hierarchy

### During Recording
1. Skeleton tracking (always visible)
2. Start/End control state
3. Timer (if recording)

### During Analysis
1. **Video with problem marker** (visual)
2. **Single coaching instruction** (text)
3. **Score** (number)
4. Detailed metrics (hidden by default)

### Visual > Textual
Always prefer:
- Overlay arrows over "move left"
- Color zones over "too far back"
- Side-by-side over descriptions

---

## Platform Adaptations

### iOS Specific
- **Haptic feedback**: Medium impact on record, light on UI actions
- **Safe areas**: Respect notch and home indicator
- **Gestures**: Swipe between shots in analysis
- **Share sheet**: Native iOS sharing for videos

### Screen Sizes
```swift
// iPhone (default)
Controls: 44pt height
Padding: 16pt

// iPad
Controls: 50pt height
Padding: 24pt
Max width: 600pt for panels
```

---

## Accessibility

- **VoiceOver**: Describe visual overlays in detail
- **Dynamic Type**: Respect for coaching text (not metrics)
- **Reduce Motion**: Simple fades instead of springs
- **High Contrast**: Darker overlays, bolder markers

---

## Design Decisions

### Why Camera First?
Users want to practice, not navigate menus. Instant camera access removes friction.

### Why One Insight?
Multiple issues overwhelm. Fix one thing per session for real improvement.

### Why Visual Overlays?
Seeing the correction on your own swing is more powerful than abstract instructions.

### Why Monospaced Metrics?
Changing numbers (6.2 → 10.0) shouldn't cause UI jumping during playback.

## Component Specifications

### Recording Controls (Start/End)
```swift
Layout: Center pill button (100×44), rounded 22pt
Labels: "START" / "END" (monospaced, 16pt, bold)
Colors: Green (START) → Red (END)
Animation: Press scale 0.95; subtle glow/shadow when recording
Accessibility: Clear labels; haptic on tap
```

### Shot Markers (Timeline)
```swift
Size: 8pt circles
Colors: Match shot quality (green/yellow/red)
Spacing: Proportional to time
Label: "FH"/"BH" + score below
```

### Insight Card
```swift
Height: Dynamic (min 100pt)
Background: .ultraThinMaterial
Border: 1pt white at 15% opacity
Padding: 16pt
Animation: Slide up + fade in
```

## Future Evolution

## Summary

Every design decision serves one goal: **help users improve their tennis technique with minimal friction**. The interface disappears when not needed, teaches through visual demonstration, and celebrates improvement. The camera view is sacred – UI elements earn their screen space by delivering immediate, actionable value.

**Remember**: Users open the app to improve their swing, not to navigate interfaces. Every pixel should teach.
